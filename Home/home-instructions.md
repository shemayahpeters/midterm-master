The home page should have the following areas of content
- title
- Introductory Text
- Date
- Location
- Featured Speakers
- Workshop Tracks with Names and Descriptions

For the featured speakers you can decide how many you want. Choose 1-4 speakers from any of the speakers I give to you in the Speakers section. The speaker(s) should be highlighted in some way on the home page.
While this uses speakers from the speakers page, this is separate from the Speakers page. That is a page that lists all of the speakers. 

On the home page the Featured Speakers is a section that will feature (highlight) 2 to 4 of the speakers. You can choose which speakers you want to highlight and how many. Choose based on what will fit into your design and which speakers or photos you like.

The home-content.txt file has the text content for those areas. In that file the lines with ** at the beginning and end are ones you should DELETE. They are just titles for the content. For the following areas you can, and probably should use the titles:

* Featured Speakers
* Workshop Session Tracks
