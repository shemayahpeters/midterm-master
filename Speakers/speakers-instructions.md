The speakers page lists all 16 of the speakers (each of the 16 workshop sessions has a speaker).

The speakers-content page lists their names and gives a short bio. Each person also has at least one image in the images folder. Some speakers have more than one image. For them you can choose the one that works best for you.

Each person should only have one image on the page. The images are of varying size and quality and it is up to you to do the best you can to edit, crop resize etc, the images so they work together.
